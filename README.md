# Employees app 

## Introduction
Made by two skilled developers, Martin and Eduard. 
This app has two pages: Tribes and Employees. It helps to keep track of Tribes and Employees data in Pipedrive's company.
Users can delete, add, or change existing employees. Isn't that cool?
Moreover, the UI is so simplistic and user-friendly, even my grandma would enjoy it (Martin forced me to write this)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: <br>
`git clone https://github.com/mk-3rd/employees-api-with-FE.git`

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory: <br>
`cd employees-api-with-FE`

3. Run `docker compose build` command <br>

4. Run `docker compose up` command <br>

5. Enjoy ^_^

## Usage
Once your docker is running, you can acces the employees app by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser
