# EMPLOYEES AP

# "Hiring and firing, as easy as it gets!"

## Introduction
Made by two skilled developers, Martin and Eduard. 
This app has two pages: Tribes and Employees. It helps to keep track of Tribes and Employees data in your company.
Users can delete, add, or change existing employees. Isn't that cool?
Moreover, the UI is so simplistic and user-friendly, even my grandma would enjoy it (Martin forced me to write this)

## Special features
Accidentally clicked the delete button and fired your employee? No need to worry. The world is full of talented people, and you don't need those who just don't have luck on their side.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: <br>
`git clone https://github.com/mk-3rd/employees-api-with-FE.git`

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory: <br>

3. Run `docker compose build` command <br>
